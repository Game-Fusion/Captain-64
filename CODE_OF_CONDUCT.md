## Game Fusion Commander 64 Code of Conduct

By helping this project, you agree to conform to certain standards:

- You will contribute to this project without provoking other contributors or members

- You will not demonstrate actions of insulting other projects - Commander 64 is a respectable project but no other project deserves to be dissed (ie. being insulted for lacking features) - instead, why don't you tell the other projects what they're doing wrong and make them better?

- You agree that your work will be credited but the Commander 64 will remain a Game Fusion entity

Failure to follow the code of conduct will result in permissions to contribute becoming redacted; Commander 64 project encourages people to work together, not against each other.

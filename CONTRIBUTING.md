# Contributing

Note: Game Fusion appreciates your interest in the Commander project. We try to make the project as welcoming as we can and it means a lot that you are considering helping us out. It's interested people like you that are the reason for Commander's existence. Without you, this project wouldn't exist. Thank you.

Commander 64 is a project that thrives on community feedback and consults the audience to deliver the best possible workstation experience. Anyone and everyone who has input and suggestions on how to make C64 the best it can be is entitled to help out if they want to.

## How you can help:

- If you find a bug, submit an issue in the "Issues" tab at the top of the page describing this and we'll do our best to fix it

- Testing (see below)

- ADDING CODE - Yes, we encourage you to Fork this project, improve the code and submit it to us. We appreciate your efforts and we'd love to see what we could do.


### Testing

Testing is a very important part of the Commander project. We like to test our software vigorously to ensure tight and high quality standards and that our products are the best they can be. If you want to test Commander 64 yourself, here's how;

- Open up ComputerCraft

- Use HTTP to download Commander 64 (Or, on CubeSpace, the `wget` command) files (eg. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Game-Fusion/Commander-64/master/files/startup startup`)

- Test!

* Ensure you have all the APIs downloaded otherwise it may not work as intended

My vision for the project is to create the most minimalist workstation experience ever to ensure it's just you and the computer - no layers of unnecessary graphics or animations in the way of it, this is your code and you're writing code for the computer. Minimal graphics also ensures maximum performance and minimum amount of calls so Commander 64 will perform to the highest standard.

If you would like to contact me for further info, you can message me on CubeSpace or on Discord (TheMrIron2#9747).
